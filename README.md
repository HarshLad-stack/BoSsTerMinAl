🚀 Velostack Boss Terminal [Ignore those empty classes for now]

Welcome to my custom, ultra-flexible terminal!

This is a fun side project I’m slowly building — a standalone terminal in Java with Linux vibes, full branding, and lots of chaos potential. Think of it like your own hacker playground, but Velostack style.

🎨 Features (so far)

🔥 Big ASCII banner on startup — totally customizable

💻 Linux-style prompt:

velostack@DESKTOP-H6DNA49:~$


📝 Command input loop — type commands, see output

⛔ Exit command — shut down cleanly

🛠️ Planned Features / Coming Soon

Run programs directly → Java, Python, C, etc.

Full Linux cmd support (ls, pwd, cd, …)

Custom commands:

/help → list all commands

/prank → fun fake errors, warnings, alerts

/stress <url> → integration with HTTP Stress Court project

/verdict → fun analytics & verdicts

/clear → clears terminal output

Customizable banners & colors

Internal state → track cwd, environment, history

Logging & database → optional command tracking

Animations & dramatic output → terminal flex

💡 Why this is awesome

You’re building a real developer tool, not just another app

Full control & branding — you are the boss

Hands-on experience with:

ProcessBuilder in Java

I/O formatting

Shell state management

Optional database logging

Endless potential for fun commands, pranks, and verdicts

⚡ How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/VelostackBossTerminal.git
cd VelostackBossTerminal


Compile Java files:

javac -d out src/org/dev/velostack/*.java


Run:

java -cp out org.dev.velostack.BossTerminal

🎯 How to Play / Contribute

Right now, type anything — it’ll echo back

You can change the banner in Ansi.java

Later, try /prank, /stress, or add your own commands

Fork it, submit ideas, or just watch it evolve

⚠️ Notes

Personal side project → development is gradual

Expect fun quirks, pranks, and custom Linux-like commands over time

Terminal is extensible — make it yours!
